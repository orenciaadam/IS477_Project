    "# Status Report\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of Planned Work\n",
    "Reflecting on Milestone 2, our project plan outlined an approach to investigate factors that influence IMDb ratings of Netflix movies by integrating two data sources: the Netflix IMDb dataset from Kaggle and the OMDb API. Planned tasks included reproducible data acquisition, structured storage, data cleaning, merging using a shared primary key (IMDb ID), and preliminary data analysis. In this milestone, we focused on strengthening reproducibility in our workflow and aligning each step with the complete data lifecycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Acquisition & Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "### Netflix Dataset\n",
    "- Downloaded and placed under `data/raw/`\n",
    "- Includes attributes such as:\n",
    "  - `title`\n",
    "  - `type`\n",
    "  - `release_year`\n",
    "  - `age_certification`\n",
    "  - `runtime`\n",
    "  - `imdb_id`\n",
    "  - `imdb_score`\n",
    "  - `imdb_votes`\n",
    "\n",
    "### OMDb API Dataset\n",
    "- Retrieved using `scripts/fetch_omdb.py`\n",
    "- Uses IMDb IDs for consistent linkage\n",
    "- Raw responses stored in `omdb_raw.jsonl` for provenance\n",
    "- Selected attributes exported to `omdb_from_netflix.csv`\n",
    "- API keys securely handled through ignored local config files\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Cleaning & Primary Key Preparation\n",
    "Initial preprocessing of the Netflix dataset used `scripts/clean_netflix.py`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Filters rows with valid IMDb IDs  \n",
    "- Standardizes IMDb ID formatting  \n",
    "- Outputs:\n",
    "  - `netflix_clean.csv`\n",
    "  - `netflix_imdb_ids.csv`\n",
    "\n",
    "These cleaned IDs were passed into the OMDb retrieval workflow for reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Integration\n",
    "We performed an inner join on `imdb_id`, validating:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Primary key compatibility  \n",
    "- Alignment of OMDb attributes with Netflix titles  \n",
    "- Value added by OMDb-enriched metadata  \n",
    "\n",
    "The merged dataset now contains combined fields from both sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Cleaning & Quality Assessment (In Progress)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Standardization & Variable Preparation\n",
    "- Converted OMDb runtimes to numeric minutes and unified with Netflix runtimes\n",
    "- Parsed complex numerical fields (`imdbVotes`, `BoxOffice`) into float-compatible formats\n",
    "- Identified sparse fields (`Awards`, `Metascore`)\n",
    "- Resolved redundant fields (e.g., `title` vs `Title`) using `title_unified` and `release_year_clean`\n",
    "\n",
    "These efforts address inconsistencies and missing-data issues identified in Milestone 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenges Encountered\n",
    "OMDb API free-tier rate limits affected data acquisition:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Limited initial pulls to 25 → 200 titles  \n",
    "- Implemented safe-failure logic and rate-limit handling  \n",
    "- Ensured partial datasets remained reproducible  \n",
    "\n",
    "The smaller sample still provides adequate coverage for exploratory work.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Existing Artifacts in Repository\n",
    "- `scripts/clean_netflix.py`  \n",
    "- `scripts/fetch_omdb.py`  \n",
    "- `data/raw/`  \n",
    "- `data/processed/`  \n",
    "- Jupyter notebooks for exploration and validation  \n",
